### Project Report: Bank Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation


## Project Overview


This project involved analyzing a dataset related to various banks across different states and cities. The objective was to explore the dataset, extract key insights, and create visualizations and dashboards that summarize financial metrics, such as the total number of banks, total funds, and their distribution by location. The data was provided by one of my instructors.

**_Disclaimer_** : All datasets and reports do not represnt any company, institution or country, but just a dummy to demonstrate capabilities of Excel.


### Project Objectives
- Analyze bank distribution by state and city
  
- Summarize total funds for each state and track monthly trends.
  
- Identify cities with the highest and lowest funds.
  
- Create interactive visualizations that enable stakeholders to quickly grasp key performance indicators (KPIs)





### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To ensure accuracy and meaningful insights, I conducted the following steps:

- Data Cleaning: Identified and removed empty rows and errors from the dataset.
  
- Data Structuring: Converted the dataset into a table format and renamed it for easy reference.
  
- Preliminary Analysis: Used summary statistics and pivot tables to explore patterns in the data, such as:
1. Number of Banks by State
2. Total Funds by State
3. City-wise Distribution of Banks and Funds
4. Monthly Trends of Funds over Different Years
   
These preliminary insights guided the creation of visualizations and dashboards.

### Pivot Table Analysis

- State List with Total Number of Banks: Pivot table showing the number of banks in each state.
  
- State List with Total Funds: Pivot table calculating the total funds per state.
  
- City Breakdown by State: A detailed table listing all cities by state, along with the total number of banks and funds.
  
- Monthly Fund Analysis: A pivot table summarizing total funds for each year, organized by month in descending order.
  
- Line Chart Visualization: Created a line chart to represent the total number of banks by state.

## Dashboard Creation


The following KPIs and insights were summarized on the dashboard:

- Total number of banks
  
- Total funds
  
- Total states covered
  
- Top 5 cities with the highest funds
  
- Bottom 5 cities with the lowest funds
  
- Bar Chart: Total number of banks by state
  
- Line Chart: Total funds by state
  
- Pie Chart: Top 5 cities with the highest number of banks

### Formulas and Calculations

- COUNTA UNIQUE: Used to calculate the total number of banks and states. =COUNTA(UNIQUE(StateÂ )), =COUNTA((Bank Name)).
  
- SUM: Used to determine total funds for the KPIs. =SUM(Fund)


### Visual Enhancements and Refinements

- Created additional pivot tables for city-level insights:
 
- Cluster Bar Chart: Top 5 cities with the highest funds.
  
- Cluster Bar Chart: Bottom 5 cities with the lowest funds.
  
- Cluster Column Chart: State-wise total number of banks.
  
- Line Chart: Total funds by state.
  
- Pie Chart: Top 5 cities with the highest number of banks.

Adjusted chart elements (titles, sizes, colors) to enhance clarity and visual appeal.

Customized the dashboard background and applied a color theme to improve aesthetics.


### Conclusion

This project enabled me to demonstrate my skills in data exploration, analysis, and visualization. By performing EDA and leveraging pivot tables, I uncovered key insights about the banking landscape across states and cities. The dashboard provides an easy-to-understand summary, aiding in decision-making.
